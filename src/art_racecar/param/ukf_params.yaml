# REP-105 (http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0105.html) specifies four principal coordinate frames: base_link, odom, map, and
# earth. base_link is the coordinate frame that is affixed to the robot. Both odom and map are world-fixed frames.
# The robot's position in the odom frame will drift over time, but is accurate in the short term and should be
# continuous. The odom frame is therefore the best frame for executing local motion plans. The map frame, like the odom
# frame, is a world-fixed coordinate frame, and while it contains the most globally accurate position estimate for your
# robot, it is subject to discrete jumps, e.g., due to the fusion of GPS data or a correction from a map-based
# localization node. The earth frame is used to relate multiple map frames by giving them a common reference frame.
# ekf_localization_node and ukf_localization_node are not concerned with the earth frame.
# Here is how to use the following settings:
# 1. Set the map_frame, odom_frame, and base_link frames to the appropriate frame names for your system.
#     1a. If your system does not have a map_frame, just remove it, and make sure "world_frame" is set to the value of
#         odom_frame.
# 2. If you are fusing continuous position data such as wheel encoder odometry, visual odometry, or IMU data, set
#   "world_frame" to your odom_frame value. This is the default behavior for robot_localization's state estimation nodes.
# 3. If you are fusing global absolute position data that is subject to discrete jumps (e.g., GPS or position updates
# from landmark observations) then:
#     3a. Set your "world_frame" to your map_frame value
#     3b. MAKE SURE something else is generating the odom->base_link transform. Note that this can even be another state
#         estimation node from robot_localization! However, that instance should *not* fuse the global data.
map_frame: /map              # Defaults to "map" if unspecified
odom_frame: /odom            # Defaults to "odom" if unspecified
#base_link_frame: /base_laser_link
base_link_frame: /base_footprint # Defaults to "base_link" if unspecified
world_frame: /odom           # Defaults to the value of odom_frame if unspecified

# The filter accepts an arbitrary number of inputs from each input message type (nav_msgs/Odometry,
# geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped, geometry_msgs/TwistWithCovarianceStamped,
# sensor_msgs/Imu). To add an input, simply append the next number in the sequence to its "base" name, e.g., odom0,
# odom1, twist0, twist1, imu0, imu1, imu2, etc. The value should be the topic name. These parameters obviously have no
# default values, and must be specified.
odom0: /rf2o_laser_odometry/odom

# Each sensor reading updates some or all of the filter's state. These options give you greater control over which
# values from each measurement are fed to the filter. For example, if you have an odometry message as input, but only
# want to use its Z position value, then set the entire vector to false, except for the third entry. The order of the
# values is x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw, vx, vy, vz, vroll, vpitch, vyaw, ax, ay, az. Note that not some message types
# do not provide some of the state variables estimated by the filter. For example, a TwistWithCovarianceStamped message
# has no pose information, so the first six values would be meaningless in that case. Each vector defaults to all false
# if unspecified, effectively making this parameter required for each sensor.

# [ADVANCED] When measuring one pose variable with two sensors, a situation can arise in which both sensors under-
# report their covariances. This can lead to the filter rapidly jumping back and forth between each measurement as they
# arrive. In these cases, it often makes sense to (a) correct the measurement covariances, or (b) if velocity is also
# measured by one of the sensors, let one sensor measure pose, and the other velocity. However, doing (a) or (b) isn't
# always feasible, and so we expose the differential parameter. When differential mode is enabled, all absolute pose
# data is converted to velocity data by differentiating the absolute pose measurements. These velocities are then
# integrated as usual. NOTE: this only applies to sensors that provide pose measurements; setting differential to true
# for twist measurements has no effect.
#＃[高级]当使用两个传感器测量一个姿态变量时，可能会出现两个传感器报告其协方差的情况。
#这可能导致滤波器在到达每个测量值之间快速来回跳动。 在这些情况下，通常有意义的是（a）校正测量协方差，或（b）如果其中一个传感器也测量了速度，让一个传感器测量姿态，而另一个则测量速度。
#但是，执行（a）或（b）并不总是可行的，因此我们公开了微分参数。 启用差动模式后，通过区分绝对姿态测量值，所有绝对姿态数据都将转换为速度数据。 然后将这些速度像往常一样进行积分。
#注意：这仅适用于提供姿态测量的传感器； 将扭曲测量的差值设置为true无效。
odom0_differential: false

# [ADVANCED] When the node starts, if this parameter is true, then the first measurement is treated as a "zero point"
# for all future measurements. While you can achieve the same effect with the differential paremeter, the key
# difference is that the relative parameter doesn't cause the measurement to be converted to a velocity before
# integrating it. If you simply want your measurements to start at 0 for a given sensor, set this to true.
odom0_relative: false

# [ADVANCED] If your data is subject to outliers, use these threshold settings, expressed as Mahalanobis distances, to
# control how far away from the current vehicle state a sensor measurement is permitted to be. Each defaults to

# required. Data is specified at the level of pose and twist variables, rather than for each variable in isolation.
# For messages that have both pose and twist data, the parameter specifies to which part of the message we are applying
# the thresholds.
#[高级]如果数据受异常值影响，请使用表示为马哈拉诺比斯距离的这些阈值设置来控制允许传感器测量距当前车辆状态多远。
#如果未指定，则每个默认值均为numeric_limits <double> :: max（）。 强烈建议删除这些参数（如果不需要）。 数据是在位姿和扭曲变量的级别上指定的，而不是单独隔离每个变量。

# [ADVANCED]  The EKF and UKF models follow a standard predict/correct cycle. During prediction, if there is no
# acceleration reference, the velocity at time t+1 is simply predicted to be the same as the velocity at time t. During
# correction, this predicted value is fused with the measured value to produce the new velocity estimate. This can be
# problematic, as the final velocity will effectively be a weighted average of the old velocity and the new one. When
# this velocity is the integrated into a new pose, the result can be sluggish covergence. This effect is especially
# noticeable with LIDAR data during rotations. To get around it, users can try inflating the process_noise_covariance
# for the velocity variable in question, or decrease the  variance of the variable in question in the measurement
# itself. In addition, users can also take advantage of the control command being issued to the robot at the time we
# make the prediction. If control is used, it will get converted into an acceleration term, which will be used during

# [ADVANCED] The process noise covariance matrix can be difficult to tune, and can vary for each application, so it is

# prediction step. The better the omnidirectional motion model matches your system, the smaller these values can be.
# However, if users find that a given variable is slow to converge, one approach is to increase the
# process_noise_covariance diagonal value for the variable in question, which will cause the filter's predicted error
# to be larger, which will cause the filter to trust the incoming measurement more during correction. The values are
